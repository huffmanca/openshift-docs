{product-title} can be provisioned with persistent storage using Ceph RBD.

Persistent volumes (PVs) and persistent volume claims (PVCs) can share 
volumes across a single project. While the Ceph RBD specific information
contained in a PV definition could also be defined directly in a pod 
definition, doing so does not create the volume as a distinct cluster
resource, making the volume more susceptible to conflicts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.
