= Using ephemeral storage

You can use ephemeral storage to:

* Determine the ephemeral storage and risk requirements of a 
containerized application component and configure the container 
ephemeral storage parameters to suit those requirements.
* Configure containerized application runtimes, such as OpenJDK, to 
adhere to the configured container ephemeral storage parameters.
* Diagnose and resolve ephemeral storage-related error conditions that 
are associated with running the storage in a container.
