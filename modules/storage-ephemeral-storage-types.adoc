= Types of ephemeral storage

Ephemeral local storage is always made available in the primary
partition. There are two basic ways of creating the primary
partition, root and runtime.

[[section-type-root]]
== Root

This partition holds the kubeletâ€™s root directory, `/var/lib/origin/` by
default, and `/var/log/` directory. This partition may be shared between 
user pods, OS, and Kubernetes system daemons. This partition can be 
consumed by pods via EmptyDir volumes, container logs, image layers, 
and container writable  layers. Kubelet manages shared access and 
isolation of this partition. This partition is ephemeral, and 
applications cannot expect any performance SLAs, such as disk IOPS, 
from this partition.

[[section-type-runtime]]
== Runtime

This is an optional partition that runtimes can use for overlay
file systems. {product-title} attempts to identify and provide
shared access along with isolation to this partition. Container image
layers and writable layers are stored here. If the runtime partition
exists, the `root` partition does not hold any image layer or other 
writable storage.

[NOTE]
====
When you use DeviceMapper to provide runtime storage, a containers' 
copy-on-write layer is not accounted for in ephemeral storage management. 
Use overlay storage to monitor this ephemeral storage.
