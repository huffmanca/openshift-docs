= Sizing

For each kind of resource, including memory, CPU, storage, and ephemeral 
storage, {product-title} allows optional *request* and *limit* values to be 
placed on each container in a pod.

* The ephemeral storage request value, if specified, influences the 
{product-title} scheduler. The scheduler considers the ephemeral storage 
request when scheduling a container to a node, then fences off the 
requested ephemeral storage on the chosen node for the use of the container.
* The ephemeral storage limit value, if specified, provides a hard limit 
on the ephemeral storage that can be allocated across all the processes in 
a container.
* If both ephemeral storage request and limit are specified, the ephemeral 
storage limit value must be greater than or equal to the ephemeral 
storage request.

The cluster administrator can assign both quota and default values for the
ephemeral storage request value, limit value, both, or neither. In 
addition, the cluster administrator can also override the ephemeral storage
request values specified by the developer in order to manage cluster
overcommitment. This occurs in OpenShift Online.
