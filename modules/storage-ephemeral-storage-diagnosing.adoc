= Diagnosing an evicted pod

{product-title} might evict a pod from its node when the node’s ephemeral 
storage is exhausted. Depending on the extent of ephemeral storage 
exhaustion, the eviction might or might not be graceful. In graceful 
eviction, the main process, PID 1, of each container receives a 
SIGTERM signal, then some time later, a SIGKILL signal if the process 
is still running. In non-graceful eviction, the main process of each 
container immediately receives a SIGKILL signal.

To get a list of all pods so you can review their statuses:

----
$ oc get pod test
NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
test      0/1       Evicted   0          1m

$ oc get pod test -o yaml
...
status:
  message: 'Pod The node was low on resource: [DiskPressure].'
  phase: Failed
  reason: Evicted
----

An evicted pod has phase *Failed* and reason *Evicted*. The evicted pod is 
not restarted, regardless of the value of *restartPolicy*. However, 
controllers such as the ReplicationController do notice the pod’s failed 
status and create a new pod to replace the old one.
